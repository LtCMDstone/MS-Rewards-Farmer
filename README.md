## Installation

1. Install requirements with the following command :

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   Upgrade all required with the following command:
   `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

2. Make sure you have Chrome installed

3. (Windows Only) Make sure Visual C++ redistributable DLLs are installed

   If they're not, install the current "vc_redist.exe" from this link and reboot your computer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

4. Edit the `accounts.json.sample` with your accounts credentials and rename it by removing `.sample` at the end. The "proxy" field is not mandatory, you can omit it if you don't want to use proxy (don't keep it as an empty string, remove it completely).

   - If you want to add more than one account, the syntax is the following:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "username": "Your Email 1",
       "password": "Your Password 1",
       "proxy": "http://user:pass@host1:port"
     },
     {
       "username": "Your Email 2",
       "password": "Your Password 2",
       "proxy": "http://user:pass@host2:port"
